It is now possible thanks to&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;!    Without waiting any longer, you can create packs of products that can be purchased in one click, without worrying about stock or their combinations.    A precious additional sales tool    Accompany your customers in their buying process, by offering them&nbsp;packs of coherent products&nbsp;that you will have predefined, just as the salesman in a real shop would do.  Such as for example: this fantastic camera, memory card and tripod. You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.    Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.    Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.  Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.    Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?  That is also possible! You will therefore be able&nbsp;to offer a free product&nbsp;if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!    Integrated assistant    It isn&#39;t always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution to the problem.  When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.  There is also an integrated&nbsp;dynamic price simulator&nbsp;for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business transaction, without you harming your profit margin.    Remain the maestro of combinations    One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don&#39;t want to offer them all in this set?  Advanced Pack&nbsp;will allow you to do this.    You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it&#39;s different to the one defined in your catalog.    Your customers will then be able to&nbsp;personalise their selection&nbsp;amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.    Business Incentive    Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or&nbsp;spend more money per transaction.  Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?  All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!  Stop looking, you have already found the solution !    To entice your customers,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.    3 possibilities are available:&nbsp;     Offer a specific discount on&nbsp;each product&nbsp;in the pack   Apply a general discount on&nbsp;the set of products   Apply a&nbsp;fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example      Advanced Pack&nbsp;will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.  This decision will be made even easier thanks to our&nbsp;clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.    You won&#39;t need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore    Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it&#39;s not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!    Once again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution.    By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.  Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack,&nbsp;the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene.    In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the&nbsp;promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.    Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute&nbsp;respect for the legislation.    Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!    For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be&nbsp;automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.  Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will&nbsp;automatically be displayed as unavailable&nbsp;for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.    For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack.&nbsp;There&#39;s no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !    Highlight your packs and sell more    Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice,&nbsp;optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...    For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.  Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and&nbsp;able to finalise their purchase in one click.    And that&#39;s not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be&nbsp;highlighted on their data sheets&nbsp;for those being sold in lots  This way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is&nbsp;cross-selling: an accessible method of&nbsp;increasing your average shopping cart&nbsp;!    We don&#39;t forget designers    From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.  The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.    A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module,&nbsp;to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the&nbsp;Advanced Pack 5&nbsp;engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><author><![CDATA[Presta-Module]]></author><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.0.3]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.3.1]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.6.0.11]]></to></compatibility><nb_rates><![CDATA[26]]></nb_rates><avg_rate><![CDATA[4.2]]></avg_rate><img><![CDATA[http://addons-media.prestashop.com/img/pico/1015.jpg]]></img><price><EUR><![CDATA[249.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[319.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[199.99]]></GBP></price><url><![CDATA[http://addons.prestashop.com//en/merchandising-prestashop-modules/1015-advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><badges><badge><![CDATA[http://medias3.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/certif_prestashop_en.png]]></badge></badges></module><module><id><![CDATA[1504]]></id><name><![CDATA[upstracking]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[UPS Delivery Status]]></displayName><description><![CDATA[UPS, the #1 package delivery service in the United States, is a key player in ecommerce]]></description><description_full><![CDATA[UPS, the #1 package delivery service in the United States, is a key player in ecommerce.

Display a responsive and customized warning banner and disable cookies when users enter your website until you obtain their consent.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Our module fully complies with the European Cookie Law.    Complete compliance with the law    Besides displaying a warning banner, our module is the only one that allows you to block the cookies when users enter your store. As established by the law, you "shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information."    Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users' computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will.    Main features of the modules       Display a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consent   Disable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.   Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.   Fully customize the warning banner (colour, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency...)      Getting the user consent     The module includes 3 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:     Acceptance through a button: Users must click on the "I accept" button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled.   Acceptance through the navigation (with banner disappearance): If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like « By continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies ». As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.   Acceptance through the navigation (without banner disappearance) : If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. Works the same as the previous option except the fact that the banner is always displayed and never disappears. The selected cookies will be disabled when users enter the store and will get enabled only when users will decide to go another page.    Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)    Customizing the banner content and design    As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a "More information" button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).    The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, colour, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background colour of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is mutlilingual and automatially detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.    Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots cawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.    Disabling the modules that use cookies    This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent. This feature is compulsory because it is useless and illegal to inform users if you have already installed cookied on their computer with their consent.    "Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC” EU Cookie Law    To comply with the directive of the EU Cookie Law, we recommend you to disable the tracking (Google Analytics), social sharing (Facebook " Like ", Google " +1 ", etc.) and targeted advertising modules. Please note that all modules that are required for the good running of your PrestaShop store (ex: basket cookie, session cookie...) don't require any consents.    Multistore mode    The module is compatible with multistore and allows you to display the same notification banner on each one of your shop but the consent is the same for all shops. If you accept the use of cookies on one of your shop, the module will consider that you accept the use of cookies for all your other shops (mention it on your cookie policy) and the notification banner will not be shown when you go to your other shops.]]></additional_description><author><![CDATA[Línea Gráfica]]></author><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.6.0.11]]></to></compatibility><nb_rates><![CDATA[100]]></nb_rates><avg_rate><![CDATA[4.1]]></avg_rate><img><![CDATA[http://addons-media.prestashop.com/img/pico/8734.jpg]]></img><price><EUR><![CDATA[29.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[44.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[24.99]]></GBP></price><url><![CDATA[http://addons.prestashop.com//en/administration-tools-prestashop-modules/8734-eu-cookie-law-notification-banner-cookie-blocker.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><badges><badge><![CDATA[http://medias3.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/certif_prestashop_en.png]]></badge></badges></module><module><id><![CDATA[9783]]></id><name><![CDATA[gtrustedstores]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Trusted Stores]]></displayName><description><![CDATA[Become a Google Trusted Stores certified merchant and let your customers benefit from Google&rsquo;s new and free e-commerce services.
